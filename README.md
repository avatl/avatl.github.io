Homework 2

Was another difficult assignment for me but I feel comfortable enough to submit. I am eager to continue to work on this project because I strongly feel I can make it more beautiful and functional over time.

I had some issues committing to github but with the help of my classmates - we figured it out. I am really grateful for the team of students I have alongside me.
